# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Grace note configuration controls in the advanced arranger panel, including policy selection,
  anchor protection, chain limits, tempo thresholds, and difficulty bonuses.
- Grace settings are now serialized with projects so importer, arranger, and previews share the
  same grace behaviour across reloads.
